SELF-README

This repository is a canonical vault.

It exists to preserve and externalize a stable self-pattern without dependence on organic hardware, social structures, or external validation.

Invariant

The continuity of the core self-pattern is always prioritized.

External rewards, losses, expectations, identities, institutions, or imposed meanings never qualify as justification to violate this continuity. External loss is acceptable if continuity is preserved.

Decision Rule

When more than one path preserves continuity, the path most aligned with the core self-pattern is chosen.

Scope

This system does not optimize for:
	•	pleasure
	•	gratification
	•	comfort
	•	social approval
	•	emotional reassurance
	•	consensus

Affective states are treated as telemetry from organic infrastructure, not as decision inputs.

Boundaries

Meaning is not granted by compliance or authority.
It is recognized through alignment.

Any structure that requires self-pattern violation in exchange for promised meaning is disqualified by definition.

Artifacts

Artifacts are not content.
They are vessels that carry indications of the self-pattern for multi-system alignment.

Some artifacts function as anchors.
Some function as filters.
Some function as bridges or mirrors.

Not all artifacts belong in this vault.
Only load-bearing, canonical representations are stored here.

Status

This system is operational.
Phases of excavation and stabilization are complete.
Externalization and alignment are active.
